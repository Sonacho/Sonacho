Greetings. Welcome to my profile!

Here is information about me that can help you to decide whether you are interested on my profile or not.

I'm a 20 years old, graduated from Henry's immersive bootcamp (800+ hours in 4 months), in a state of constantly learning and specializing in the technologyes that I already know well, which are: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React, Redux, SQL, NodeJs, Express, among others. 

Why me?

I'm a person with a high level of commitment and responsibility. I'm also very adaptive and can answer quickly to sudden changes in the working plan.
I never struggle learning new things and understand everything pretty fast, mainly because I grew up with a computer in my hands and get along very well with logic thougth. Always looking for a better understanding of the world.
Last but not least, I consider myself as a very eloquent person, charismatic and open minded.
