Welcome to my profile!

ðŸ‘¾ I'm a passionate Full Stack web developer interested in front-end as much as back-end. I really like challenges, creating and learning. I am an empathetic, curious, open-minded person, charismatic and responsable person.

ðŸ’¼ I have worked individually and I have had the pleasure of being able to meet and work as a team with good people who helped me a lot to develop my skills, learn, improve my practices. These were important experiences for me as they helped me grow as a developer and as a person.

ðŸ“ŒI invite you to see my projects! Scrolling down you will find my pinned repositories.

ðŸŽ“ Full Stack Developer & Economics and Management of Organizations.
